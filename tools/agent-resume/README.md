# Agent session resume on pane restore

Make Warp re-launch your Claude Code / Codex sessions when it restores tabs after a
quit/relaunch. Warp restores each pane's layout + cwd as usual; this adds: capture the
agent session that was running in each pane, and on restore re-run its exact resume
command (`claude --resume <id>` / `codex resume <id>`) once the shell finishes booting.

macOS only. Personal build.

## How it works

```
capture (agent SessionStart hooks)          replay (Rust, in Warp)
  claude hook     ─┐                          snapshot(): read registry[pane_uuid]
  codex hooks     ─┼─► ~/.warp/agent-resume/    → freeze command into the pane snapshot
                   │     <pane_uuid>.json        → persisted in SQLite (terminal_panes)
                   │     { "command", "cwd" }            │
                   └────────────────────────►   restore: after the shell's first
                                                 Bootstrapped event, run the command
```

- **Capture is a `SessionStart` hook**, for both Claude and Codex. The hook reads the
  *actual* live `session_id` from its payload and the pane UUID from the inherited
  `WARP_TERMINAL_SESSION_UUID` env var. This captures the right session in every case —
  fresh start, `--resume <id>`, the interactive picker, and `--continue` — because the
  hook runs *after* the agent has decided which session is live. (An earlier `claude()`
  shell wrapper had to guess the id before launch, so it silently missed the picker and
  `--continue`; it was removed.)
- **Key = the pane UUID** (`WARP_TERMINAL_SESSION_UUID`), which is stable across
  quit/restore and unique per tab — so multiple agents in the *same directory* are
  disambiguated (a directory-based scheme can't do that).
- **The recorded command self-heals**: it is `warp_agent_resume_launch <agent> <id>`,
  a shell function (sourced from `claude.zsh`) that resumes the session only if it has a
  real conversation on disk, and otherwise starts a *fresh* agent in that pane. This
  matters because the command is captured eagerly at launch (you usually quit with the
  agent still running), so it can point at a session that was opened but never used — and
  `claude --resume`/`codex resume` reject those with "No conversation found". Resumability
  is checked by locating the session file by its globally-unique id, so we never replicate
  each agent's brittle cwd→directory hashing.
- **Warp stays agent-agnostic**: Rust only stores/replays an opaque command string.
  Adding another agent later is just another capture script — no Rust change.

## Install (capture layer)

```bash
./tools/agent-resume/install.sh
# then restart your shell (or: source ~/.zshrc) to load the replay functions
```

Installs the capture hooks + the registry CLI into `~/.warp/agent-resume-bin/`, and wires:
the Claude `SessionStart` hook into `~/.claude/settings.json` (jq merge — existing settings
are preserved), the Codex `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd` hooks into `~/.codex/config.toml`, and
the replay functions into `~/.zshrc`. Requires `jq` (`brew install jq` if needed).

The hooks only record when launched inside a Warp pane (`WARP_TERMINAL_SESSION_UUID` set).
New Claude sessions are captured immediately — no shell restart needed for capture; the
restart only loads the replay functions used on the next restore.

## Build the app (replay layer)

```bash
./tools/agent-resume/build-app.sh
```

Builds the **OSS-channel** Warp with this feature compiled in, names it "Elliot's Warp"
(set `WARP_ELLIOT_NAME` to change), and installs it to `/Applications`. The rename is
cosmetic (display + bundle name); the bundle id stays `dev.warp.WarpOss`. It co-installs
alongside your downloaded Warp:
different bundle id (`dev.warp.WarpOss` vs `dev.warp.Warp-Stable`) and a separate data
dir (`~/.warp-oss`), so the two never clobber each other's session state.

## What survives what

| Scenario | Resumes? |
|---|---|
| `Cmd-Q` / update-and-restart | ✅ yes |
| Crash | ⚠️ best-effort — Warp has **no periodic autosave**; pane state is saved on UI mutations and flushed at quit (`on_will_terminate`). A crash recovers only what was last saved. No worse than today. |
| Machine reboot | resumes the *conversation* (`--resume`), never the live process — that's physics, not a bug. |

## Known limitations

- **Graceful-exit behavior:** the Claude hook does *not* remove the registry entry when a
  session ends (only overwrites it when the next session starts in that pane). This is the
  safe default — it guarantees the entry is present when Warp snapshots at quit (you
  usually quit with the agent still running). The cost is that a session you closed may
  reopen on the next restore. Removing on exit would risk the opposite, worse failure: the
  entry vanishing before Warp snapshots, so a session you *were* using doesn't come back.
  (Codex removes on `SessionEnd`; that race is pre-existing and accepted there.)
- **`claude --print` / `-p` is also captured.** The hook can't tell a one-off print
  invocation from an interactive session, so a pane whose last Claude activity was a
  `claude -p` may reopen that conversation on restore. Harmless — you can exit it — and an
  interactive session started afterward overwrites the entry.
- **Stub / vanished sessions resume as fresh, not as an error.** A pane whose agent was
  opened but never used has no resumable conversation (0 turns), and a session file can
  also be rolled away. Rather than replaying a bare `claude --resume <id>` that errors
  with "No conversation found", the recorded `warp_agent_resume_launch` checks first and
  starts a fresh agent in that pane instead. The trade-off is a (rare) false negative:
  if the resumability check can't find a conversation that actually exists, you get a
  fresh agent and can still `claude --resume <id>` by hand.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `warp-agent-resume` | registry CLI: `write <uuid> <cmd> <cwd>` / `remove <uuid>` |
| `claude-session-start.sh` | Claude `SessionStart` hook — captures the live session per pane |
| `claude.zsh` | replay functions (`warp_agent_resume_resumable` / `warp_agent_resume_launch`) |
| `codex-session-start.sh` / `codex-session-end.sh` | Codex hooks |
| `config.toml.snippet` | Codex hook registration (installer applies it) |
| `install.sh` | install capture hooks + replay functions into the shell/agent config |
| `build-app.sh` | build + brand + install the co-installable app |
| `tests/` | self-contained shell tests for the scripts |

Rust side: `app/src/agent_resume.rs` (registry reader), the `on_restore_command` field
on `TerminalPaneSnapshot`, the `terminal_panes.on_restore_command` column, and the
replay in `app/src/pane_group/mod.rs` + `pty_controller.rs`.
