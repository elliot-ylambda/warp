# Warp agent-resume shell integration (sourced from ~/.zshrc).
#
# Capture is done by Claude's SessionStart hook (claude-session-start.sh) and Codex's
# SessionStart hook -- they record the live session per pane. This file only provides the
# *replay* side, the functions Warp invokes on restore:
#
#   warp_agent_resume_resumable() true if an agent session id has a resumable conversation
#   warp_agent_resume_launch()    resume if possible, else start fresh
#
# On restore Warp replays the recorded command `warp_agent_resume_launch <agent> <id>` in
# this (interactive) shell, so these functions are in scope. A fresh fallback calls the
# agent normally, so its SessionStart hook re-captures it for next time.

# Returns 0 if <agent>'s session <id> has a *resumable* conversation on disk.
#
# Resumable means a session file exists AND contains at least one real turn. We locate the
# file by its globally-unique session id (so we never replicate each agent's brittle
# cwd->directory hashing). A session that was opened but never used has only a stub/metadata
# line and no real turn -- that is exactly the case `<agent> resume <id>` rejects with
# "No conversation found", so we must treat it as not-resumable and start fresh instead.
